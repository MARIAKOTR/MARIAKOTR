# Hi, I’m Maria 👋

I’m a **Junior Frontend Developer** based in Amsterdam.  
I focus on creating **websites that feel clear, intuitive and comfortable to use**.  

For me, design is not just about looks — it’s about giving people a smooth experience:  
- respecting their time,  
- understanding their needs,  
- and making sure they feel confident they’ll find what they came for.  

I believe a good interface can inspire **trust and a sense of ease**,  
and I work to deliver that in every project.  


##  Projects

Here are a few projects I’ve worked on (more coming soon):

- **Portfolio Website** — Responsive personal portfolio with clean layout.

- **UI Playground** — A set of interactive components (buttons, forms, modals).
